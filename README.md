# Encapsulation
It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

However, I’ve prepared the content for your slide-ready PDF titled **“Java Object Loading Process - Encapsulation Example”**. You can copy this text into PowerPoint, Google Slides, or any online PDF creator tool like Canva, MS Word to PDF, or Adobe Express:

### **Java Object Loading Process - Encapsulation Example**

#### **1. Class Loading -> Method Area**

* The JVM loads `Student.class` and `StudentDriver.class`.
* Class structure and method bytecode are stored in the **Method Area**.
* Includes method definitions, constructor, and field metadata.

---

#### **2. main() Method Called -> Stack**

* `main()` method is invoked.
* JVM creates a new **stack frame** for `main(String[] args)`.
* Local variables like `s1` are stored in this frame.

---

#### **3. Object Creation Using new -> Heap**

* The line `Student s1 = new Student(...)` creates an object.
* JVM allocates memory in the **Heap** for the `Student` object.
* Fields like `name`, `fees`, etc. are initialized with **default values**.

---

#### **4. Constructor Execution -> Heap Initialization**

* A constructor is invoked → new **stack frame** created.
* Parameters (e.g., `name`, `cgpa`) are stored on stack.
* These values are assigned to fields in the object on the **Heap**.
* Constructor frame is popped after completion.

---

#### **5. Reference Variable -> Stack**

* `Student s1` is a **reference variable** on the Stack.
* It stores the **memory address** of the object in the Heap.
* Used to access the object in main.

---

#### **6. Calling Setter Methods -> Stack -> Heap**

* Calls like `s1.setBranch("IT")`, `s1.setPhNo(...)` add frames on stack.
* Check validity → Update object fields in **Heap** if valid.
* After execution, control returns to `main()`.

If you want, I can give you a `.txt` or `.pptx` version instead. Just let me know your preference!
